Program 1: Hello, Python
Problem Statement:
Write a program that prints "Hello, Python!" on the screen.
print ('Hello, Python')


Program 2: Print Personal Information
Problem Statement:
Write a program that stores your name, age, and city in variables and prints them in a formatted sentence.
Name = "Jaagrav"
Age = 18
Country = "India"

print(f"My name is {Name}. I am {Age} years old and I live in {Country}.")


Program 3: Simple Arithmetic Operations
Problem Statement:
Take integers as input and display their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.

a = 5
b = 10
a = 10
b = 25
c = 15
d = 30
e = 2
f = 3
g = 5
h = 99999999999999999
i = 54321

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a//b)
print(a%b)

print(3/4)
print(3//4)
print(3%4)
print(3**4)
print(h*i)

w = a+b-c
x = d**e
y = f%g

print(w,x,y)


Program 4: Area of a Rectangle
Problem Statement:
Ask the user for the length and breadth of a rectangle and calculate its area.

b = input('Enter Value:  ')
h = input('Enter Value:  ')

base = int(b)
height = int(h)

area = 1/2*(base*height)
print(area)


Program 5: Assume a suitable value for temprature of a city in Fahrenheit degress. Write a program to convert this temprature into Centigrade degrees and print both tempratures

# Assume a suitable value for temperature in Fahrenheit
temperature_fahrenheit = 68  # You can change this value (e.g., 32, 212, 98.6)

# Convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade
temperature_centigrade = (temperature_fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

# Print both temperatures
print(f"Fahrenheit: {temperature_fahrenheit:.2f}")
print(f"Centigrade: {temperature_centigrade:.2f}")


Program 6: Even or Odd Checker
Problem Statement:
Take an integer as input and determine whether it is even or odd.

num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is odd.")


Program 7: Maximum of Two Numbers
Problem Statement:
Take two numbers as input and print the larger number. If both are equal, print a suitable message

num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

if num1 > num2:
    print(f"{num1} is larger.")
elif num2 > num1:
    print(f"{num2} is larger.")
else:
    print("Both numbers are equal.")


Program 8: Simple Interest Calculator
Problem Statement:
Calculate Simple Interest using
SI = (P × R × T) / 100,
where P = principal, R = rate, T = time.

P = float(input("Enter the principal amount (P): "))
R = float(input("Enter the rate of interest (R) in percentage: "))
T = float(input("Enter the time (T) in years: "))   
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
print(f"Simple Interest is: {SI}") 


Program 9: String Length Finder
Problem Statement:
Ask the user for a string and print the number of characters in it (excluding spaces).

user_string = input("Enter a string: ")
# Remove spaces from the string
string_without_spaces = user_string.replace(" ", "")
# Calculate the length of the string without spaces
length = len(string_without_spaces)
print(f"The number of characters (excluding spaces) is: {length}")


Program 10: Swap Two Variables
Problem Statement:
Swap the values of two variables:
Using a temporary variable
Without using a temporary variable

# Using a temporary variable
a = 5
b = 10
temp = a
a = b
b = temp
print(f"After swap using temporary variable: a = {a}, b = {b}")
# Without using a temporary variable
a = 5
b = 10
a, b = b, a # Swapping values using tuple unpacking
print(f"After swap without using temporary variable: a = {a}, b = {b}")
