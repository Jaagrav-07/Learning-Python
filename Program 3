Program 3: Simple Arithmetic Operations
Problem Statement:
Take integers as input and display their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.

a = 5
b = 10
a = 10
b = 25
c = 15
d = 30
e = 2
f = 3
g = 5
h = 99999999999999999
i = 54321

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a//b)
print(a%b)

print(3/4)
print(3//4)
print(3%4)
print(3**4)
print(h*i)

w = a+b-c
x = d**e
y = f%g

print(w,x,y)
