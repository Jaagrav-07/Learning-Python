#Program 6: Count Digits in a Number
#Task:
#Given an integer, count how many digits it contains.
#Constraint:
#Do not convert the number to a string.

num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
if num == 0:  
    # Checks if the input is zero since zero has one digit
    print("The number of digits in 0 is: 1") 
    # Directly prints "1" if the input was zero and ends the check there.
else:
    count = 0 
    # Initialize digit count
    temp_num = abs(num)  
    # Handle negative numbers by taking absolute value

    while temp_num > 0:
        # Starts a loop that continues as long as there are still digits left to count.
        temp_num //= 10  # Remove the last digit
        count += 1

    print(f"The number of digits in {num} is: {count}")
