#Program 2: Find the Largest of Three Numbers
#Task:
#Accept three numbers from the user and determine the largest among them without using built-in max().

num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))  
# Float - Takes that input as string and converts it into a decimal a float which is stored as variable

num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))     
if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
    largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
    largest = num2
else:
    largest = num3
